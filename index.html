<h2>Porshe Carrera GT</h2>
<p>Porsche's Carrera GT was made from 2004 to 2007. It has been and always will be one of the greatest sports cars of all time. It is powered by a 603hp 5.7L V10 engine. Its ceramic clutch system and limited slip differential make it so famous. This meant that it was extremely difficult to control the car at high speeds.

<h2>Nissan GTR</h2>
<p>The R34 GTR is a beloved Japanese sports car that is also known as one of the best cars ever made. Nissan took their original idea of the R34 sedan and turned it into a monster powered by twin turbo engines ranging in power from 411 to 1000 hp.
With 4 wheel drive and steer, controlled torque split, and active suspension, it had "new" technology for its time.

<h2>Aston Marin DBS</h2>
<p class ="funParagraph"> 
Bond was known for many things, but one of them was the Aston Martin. In the recent movies, one car stands out in particular, the 2012 Aston Martin DBS. Its V12 produced 510hp and had a 0-60 time of 4.0 seconds.
Elegant lines and timeless seams characterized this car.

<h2 id="mainHeading"> Chevy Chevelle</h2>
<p>1968's Super Sport SS 396 featured a 375-hp L78 engine, a three-speed manual transmission, and an open rear differential. Available as an option were bucket seats, gauge packages, D96 stripes, disc brakes, positraction, and a four-wheel drive system.
In my opinion, this is still one of the best looking muscle cars built between 1950 - 1970.

<h2>Ford GT</h2>
<p>  With a 4.7l 425hp engine and top speeds of over 187 mph, the Ford GT40 is an important piece of America's Automotive history. It was the first car designed and constructed in America to win the Le Mans in 1967.
